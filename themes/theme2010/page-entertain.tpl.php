													<h4>Entertainment Portal Volunteers</h4><br />
													The Entertainment Portal is a free, web based, collaborative, virtual library and a portal to the trillion+
													pages of information on the Internet. It provides the Hopefuls with instant access to the best of the best
													educational websites, videos, books/reports, photos, animations, designed especially for Hopefuls to
													assist them in their studies. All major subjects are covered including science, math, language, social
													studies, technology etc.<br /><br />

													The Entertainment Portal is similar to the hugely successful Wikipedia because it is a mass collaborative
													effort that is designed to receive content from masses of volunteers located anywhere in the world.
													However, unlike Wikipedia the Entertainment Portal Volunteers are not expected to write articles or create
													the content that is being recommended such as websites, videos and photos – instead Entertainment Portal
													volunteers are only tasked with helping us to find/filter, rate and provide a short description of the
													content.
