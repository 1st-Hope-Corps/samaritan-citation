1st Hope is partnering with Concordia High School to seek out, promote, and award acts of valor and kindness performed in our local community.  We call the acts “workz;” we define workz as noteworthy, selfless, and voluntary deeds of compassion to help another person without expecting compensation from the beneficiary.  
</p>
<p>
Using the Samaritan Workz mobile app, students and teachers issue “Samaritan Citations” to award people they observe or have become aware of doing workz for the benefit of their communities.  We recognize students and teachers who report or perform workz by awarding Valiant tokens, which they can redeem for services and products provided by local merchants.

Too often, the negative forces take center stage and get the most publicity.  People lose hope when the positive takes a back seat to the negative!   We propose to promote the positive and foster hope in our citizens by focusing on the “good” in our communities. The Good Book tells us that hope is the “anchor of the soul.”  Hope is a powerful force - a single act or phrase, even an image, can give us hope, inspire us to action, and lift the spirits of millions. Our communities will thrive on the positive… we need hope and Samaritan heroes.

Thanks again, (and again) for your participation in the 1st Hope Corps Samaritan
Citation Program, you’re making the world a better place! The Citations section is
where you can report the Workz of your local community. You can also login at

any time and check the status of the Citation regarding the awards approved for
the Samaritan and yourself.
Once you fill out and submit the Citation Report both the Samaritan and
Beneficiary are auto-enrolled in the Samaritan Citation Program; they will receive
a text message and an email that they can use to login to the Citation application.
The Samaritan can then view their Citation, a description of their Workz, and the
award status. The Beneficiary can view the Workz performed for their benefit.
No Samaritan or Beneficiary private information will be shared with the public.
The citation is also forwarded to a volunteer Reviewer for their evaluation,
approval, and assignment of a award.';

Reporting a Samaritan workz is straightforward.  To file a Samaritan Report, we request that either the Samaritan or Beneficiary be available for an interview. Hopefully, you can interview both.  In recognition of your help reporting a Samaritan Workz, you will be awarded Valiants.  To learn more, click the <span class="link menu-link" target="rewards_mobile_container">Valiant</span> link here.  Please refer to the instructions below for help conducting an interview and filling out the Samaritan report.

<div class="h3 mobile_middle_title">Step 1. Interview Samaritan and Beneficiary</div>

<p>
We ask that you have a short interview with both the Samaritan who performed the workz and the Beneficiary who benefited from the workz, and if practical, interview them separately.  When conducting the interview, introduce yourself and explain that you would like to speak with them to learn about the workz.  Be sure to inform them that the information will be used to uplift the community and inspire others to perform similar workz.  Contact information is collected from the Samaritan and Beneficiary that will enable them to become a free member of Samaritan Workz and for us to send them the Samaritan Report when it’s available for viewing.  If either the Samaritan or Beneficiary wishes to remain anonymous assure them that their privacy will be honored and that their private information will remain confidential. There is no further commitment from them.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>When interviewing the Samaritan:</u></b>  inform them that if they choose to become a member, we will auto-enroll them in the Samaritan Workz Program.  The Samaritan can receive a text message and an email that they can use to view their citation and the Samaritan Report.  Advise them that the Samaritan Report will be reviewed and published ASAP and they are eligible to receive a Valiant award.  In the meantime, they can login to the app and see the status of the Workz Report.
</p>
<p>
<b>When interviewing the Beneficiary:</b>  ask them to describe the workz and to rate how they feel about the help they received from the Samaritan. Inform the Beneficiary that they will be auto-enrolled in the Samaritan Workz Program if they become members.  They can receive a text message and/or an email that they can use to view the workz performed by the Samaritan.   Ask the Beneficiary if they have the opportunity. Can they pay the workz forward to another member of the community?
</p>

<div class="h3 mobile_middle_title">Step 2.  Fill Out the Samaritan Report</div>
<p>
Fill out the Samaritan and Beneficiary information with as much detail as possible.  
The workz performed by the Samaritan for the Beneficiary is classified as workz of Valor, Kindness, or Random Kindness.

		<u>Valor:</u> is defined as a workz of courage performed under circumstances of danger.  The courageous act is then further categorized as bronze, silver, or gold based on the degree of valor demonstrated by the Samaritan.
	</p>
	<p>
		<u>Kindness:</u> a workz of kindness is any unselfish gesture, action, or behavior intended to impact a beneficiary positively. It can be small or large, planned or spontaneous, and involve different effort or sacrifice levels. Examples include picking up trash, painting, planting, grocery shopping, etc.  Kindness workz is performed without any expectation of compensation and is categorized as Commendable, Meritorious, or Distinguished based on the degree of kindness demonstrated by the Samaritan.
	</p>
	<p>
		<u>Random Kindness:</u> is defined as a small and unplanned act of kindness without any expectation of recognition or reward. It can be as simple as holding a door open for someone, buying a cup of coffee for a stranger, or leaving a kind note.
